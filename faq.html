            <font color="#333333" size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Frequently 
            Asked Questions</strong></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How 
            did you find this money?</strong><br>
            <br>
            We audit the files of many government agencies and public corporations 
            for unclaimed funds and assets owing to people just like you.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How 
            did you find me?</strong><br>
            <br>
            We use many methods to locate claimants. Web searches, phone books 
            and specialty software are all used to locate people. Often, it can 
            take months of researching.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How 
            big is my claim? Where are the funds being held?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Once you have signed our contingency agreement and the limited power 
            of attorney, we will immediately inform you of the amount and where 
            it is located.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Where 
            did this money come from?</strong><br>
            <br>
            This will also be revealed once the agreements are signed.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>How 
            much time do I have to collect my money?</strong><br>
            <br>
            These agencies nearly always provide a narrow window of opportunity 
            for you to claim your funds. After that they will usually allow the 
            money to &quot;escheat&quot; straight into their own government accounts 
            and you will never have a second chance.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>When 
            should we start?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Today, if at all possible! </font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>When 
            will I receive my money?</strong><br>
            <br>
            It usually takes about two weeks for the agency to process the claim. 
            Once it has been approved we hold the check for thirty days to make 
            certain there are no problems with the agency then we over-night your 
            check straight to you.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Is 
            this legal?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Absolutely it is! If you are the true owner of some unclaimed funds 
            then you have every right to claim them before they are lost to the 
            government. It is also completely legal for us to act as your agent 
            and deal with these agencies on your behalf.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Why 
            can't I just find this money myself?</strong><br>
            <br>
            You can try but it's unlikely that you'll be successful, especially 
            since you will likely be working against a deadline. We maintain a 
            comprehensive database of sources of funds. It takes weeks and months 
            of searching and knowing where to look and who to communicate with. 
            This is our specialty and we're good at it.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Why 
            should I use your company?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Most of the assets we locate aren't found using the internet, and 
            it's unlikely that you will ever be notified of their existence. The 
            agency holding your funds may ultimately keep them if you don't claim 
            them very soon. How much effort do you really think they put into 
            contacting the rightful owners? They are the ones who benefit if a 
            claim is NOT made. <br>
            <br>
            We've already put in the long hours, hard work and deep digging for 
            you. All you need to do is agree to our proposal and collect the 'Lions 
            share' of the proceeds!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What 
            will it cost me?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Nothing. You will never incur one penny of expense with Acorn Asset Recovery. 
            We pay for everything; notaries, couriers, filing 
            fees, everything! We only get paid when your claim gets paid.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Do 
            I have to sign your documents?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Yes. It's the only way we can legally represent you, otherwise the 
            agency will refuse to deal with us. Our contingency fee agreement 
            is very simple - there is no confusing language, just a simple Acorn Asset Recovery 
            about how we split the claim, if successful. All documents that you 
            need to sign pertain only to your particular claim and give us no 
            power relating to anything else in your life. We will not have access 
            to your personal financial information, or the ability to make decisions 
            on your behalf relating to anything other than this claim. All document 
            signings will be done in the presence of a licensed notary public.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>I'm 
            just not comfortable with this...what can I do?</strong><br>
            <br>
            There are several things you can and should do right now. Keep in 
            mind there is only a short window of time for you to collect these 
            funds. Talk to your family members or an attorney about it and feel 
            free to have them contact us as well. Our contingency agreement is 
            available for you to review before hand, just ask one of our specialist.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Can someone else handle this for me?</strong><br>
            <br>
            Absolutely. You can have a family member or trusted advisor call us 
            and we will explain everything to them. You will, however, need to 
            be present for the signing of the documents. We do need the actual 
            claimant's signature and to verify that person's identity (driver's 
            license or other identification) before we can process your claim.</font></p>
